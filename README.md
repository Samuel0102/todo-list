### Requirements to coding
* Requires the installation of all Flask libraries and dependencies, indicated in the requirements.txt file 

### System Execution
1. Download the zip from the repository
2. In the root folder "todo-list", create a virtual environment  
2.1 The creation can be done by downloading the "virtualenv" library and running the command `virtualenv -p python virtual_environment` from root.
3. Inside the virtual environment, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` which will install all the necessary dependencies   
3.1 The environment can be accessed by typing `. virtual_environment/bin/activate` in the root, making the environment activate  
3.1.1 To deactivate: `deactivate`.
4. With all dependencies installed, just run the script "run_server.py" which contains the system and server initializer  
4.1 For execution it is necessary, after installing dependencies and the virtual environment, to change the default python interpreter to the "venv" interpreter. In VSCODE, thanks to the directory ".vscode" it is possible just by clicking on the bottom left corner, where you find the python version. When you click, just choose the interpreter, on the screen that appears at the top, "python 3.8.5 64 bit ('venv': venv)"  
5. With the server booted up, just type in the browser "localhost:5000"
